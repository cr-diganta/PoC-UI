A sleek, modern UI to test your RESTful APIs, featuring an integrated Google Gemini assistant to provide expert-level analysis of API responses.

*(Add a screenshot of your application here)*

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, browser-based interface for interacting with and testing RESTful APIs. It's designed for developers who need a quick, efficient, and intelligent tool for API development and demonstration. The key differentiator is its built-in AI assistant, powered by the Google Gemini API, which offers expert-level analysis of your API's performance, security, and structure.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Full REST Client**: Send `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` requests with custom headers and JSON bodies.
-   **Intelligent AI Analysis**: Use the power of Google Gemini to get expert feedback on your API responses, including status codes, headers, and body structure.
-   **Connection Manager**: A central hub to perform CRUD operations on various service connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Milvus).
-   **Integrated Connection Testing**: Securely test database connections via your own configurable backend endpoint.
-   **Rich Response Viewer**: View formatted and syntax-highlighted JSON responses, raw headers, response time, and size.
-   **Request History**: A persistent panel saves your recent requests for easy re-use.
-   **Modern & Responsive UI**: A beautiful dark-themed interface built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
-   **Zero Installation Frontend**: Runs directly in the browser with no complex setup or build process required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Backend (Required for Connection Testing)**: Python with FastAPI (example provided)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started: Local Setup

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up two main components:
1.  **The Frontend**: The UI itself, which runs in your browser.
2.  **The Backend**: A simple FastAPI server, which is **required** for the "Test Connection" feature to work.

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8 or later)
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**: Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project from your GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### 2. Configure the Gemini API Key

The frontend needs your Gemini API key to analyze responses. The application is configured to read this from a specific environment variable, `process.env.API_KEY`.

For simple local hosting, you will need to replace `process.env.API_KEY!` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual key as a string.

**Example `services/geminiService.ts` modification for local testing:**

```typescript
// services/geminiService.ts

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { ApiResponse } from '../types';

// WARNING: Only for local testing. Do not commit your key to version control.
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" });

// ... rest of the file
```

### 3. Set up the FastAPI Backend (for Connection Testing)

The Connection Manager's "Test" button sends a request to a backend endpoint that you control. Here’s how to set up a minimal server.

**a. Create Project Files:**

Inside your project folder, create a new directory for your backend, e.g., `backend`. In that directory, create two files: `main.py` and `requirements.txt`.

**`backend/requirements.txt`**:
```txt
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic
```

**`backend/main.py`**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel, Extra
from typing import Any, Dict

app = FastAPI(
    title="API Test Bench Connection Tester",
    description="A backend service to verify database connection details.",
    version="1.0.0",
)

# --- IMPORTANT: Add CORS Middleware ---
# This allows the frontend UI (running on a different port) to communicate with this server.
origins = ["*"] # For development, allow all. For production, restrict to your frontend's domain.

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

class ConnectionDetails(BaseModel, extra=Extra.allow):
    """A flexible model to accept any connection details from the frontend."""
    id: str
    name: str
    type: str
    details: Dict[str, Any]

@app.post("/test-connection")
async def test_connection(connection: ConnectionDetails):
    """
    Receives connection details and simulates a connection test.
    In a real-world scenario, you would add logic here to actually
    connect to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc., based on `connection.type`.
    """
    print(f"Received request to test connection: {connection.name} ({connection.type})")
    print(f"Details: {connection.details}")

    try:
        # **Placeholder Logic**: Replace this with actual connection tests.
        if connection.name and connection.type:
            # Simulate a successful connection
            return {"message": f"Successfully connected to {connection.name}!"}
        else:
            raise ValueError("Connection name or type is missing.")
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail=f"Connection failed for '{connection.name}': {str(e)}"
        )

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Connection test server is running."}

```

**b. Install Dependencies and Run:**

Open a terminal, navigate into the `backend` directory, and run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
# On Windows:  .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your backend is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. The frontend's default test endpoint is already configured to use this address.

### 4. Running the Frontend

The frontend consists of static HTML, CSS, and JS files that can be served by any simple web server. The easiest way to do this without a complex setup is using `npx serve`.

1.  Open a **new terminal** in the root directory of the project.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

3.  The terminal will output a URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to use the application.
